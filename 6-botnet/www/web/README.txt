Although hybrid version 1.0 designed to
provide "automatic everything" it comes without
any warranty regards its functionality.
If you are using x1machine botnets
it is highly advised to have some programming
knowledge. x1machine botnets are opensource
and it is up to you to make the final code work.
If you dont know how to use provided software 
or dont know what it is for - dont use it.
x1machine provides botnets for people 
who are working with botnets for some time and 
know how to use / configure / compile / recode them.
